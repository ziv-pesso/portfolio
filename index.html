            <p>
              I am an Israeli/Panamanian UI Artist based in California. My education in Illustration helped me get a career in mobile gaming creating Concept Art, which is where I developed an interest in User Interfaces. I have been in the industry for over eight years and have shipped multiple products. I enjoy being challenged creatively and growing artistically by acquiring new skills.

Ziv definitely met the challenge, designing much of the UI/UX flows that were the connective tissue of the game. Ziv earns my highest recommendation for any UI/UX artist or designer position."

Ziv understands the product vision very well, brings a lot of great ideas to the table and delivers delightful results! He works very independently and efficiently as well. Without a doubt, Ziv will be an excellent addition to any Art team he choses to join!"

                "I have had the privilege to work with Ziv for two years at Game Closure and its sister company, GC Turbo. The one thing that stands out about Ziv is his rabid curiosity. He is constantly acquiring new skills, learning new tools and techniques, and asking unexpected questions to become a more well-rounded artist and designer.
  
                Ziv was also one of the core contributors for PokÃ©mon Medallion Battle, an authorized PokÃ©mon title exclusive for Facebook Games. Working with The PokÃ©mon Company required our artists to produce content to the highest standards and handle their IP with the utmost care--all under tight time constraints. Ziv definitely met the challenge, designing much of the UI and UX flows that were the connective tissue of the game. Ziv earns my highest recommendation for any UI/UX artist or designer position."

                "If thereâs one word that can describe Ziv, itâs âhustleâ â he doesnât shy away from hard work, heâs dedicated to always learning more, and his curiosity keeps him as updated as possible. Heâs always open and willing to learn (assess, adapt, overcome!). Ziv has no ego and that makes him an incredible team member to have in any team he chooses to be a part of.
  
                I have had the pleasure of working with him for over 2 years and throughout that timeframe Iâve seen Ziv grow immensely. Weâve worked on major league titles such as PokÃ©mon, AMC, Disney, and I can tell you Ziv not only delivers high polish work, but has the ability to juggle many projects at once and always delivers in a timely manner.
