              I am an Israeli/Panamanian UI Artist based in California. My education in Illustration helped me get a career in mobile gaming creating Concept Art, which is where I developed an interest in User Interfaces. I have been in the industry for over eight years and have shipped multiple products. I enjoy being challenged creatively and growing artistically by acquiring new skills.
